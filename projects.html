                            Worked with a team of 12 students to develop a reduced-scale prototype for a pre-deployable Martian greenhouse that will enable research-grade, plant sciences studies in closed environments. I led the subsystem in charge of designing/manufacturing the electrical hardware and developing the software for the project. We used two BeagleBone Black microcontrollers, a 35-sensor suite, and control algorithms to monitor plant health and deliver the necessary conditions for maintaining the closed environment. I directly worked on writing the driver code for the sensors, developing the control logic of the system and wiring the support circuitry for the sensors. </p>

We also had a preliminary iteration of our control algorithms to control the sensors together and the wiring and power distribution systems in place. However, we overscoped our project goals at the beginning of the academine year. We had to keep pushing deadlines because we did not realize

                            <b> What happens when you put together strobe lights and oscillating water?</b>During my senior year of MIT, I designed and built a strobe water lab with a theremin control paradigm. I wanted to add an interesting control paradigm using an instrument to the typical <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqUNd5wPGbU">Strobing Water Museum Display</a>.</p>
                            <p> <b>Structure</b>I constructed a waterproof, acrylic box in the AeroAstro machine shop and MIT Cypress Engineering Design Studio. I soldered together   LEDS and wrote 8051 assembly code to strobe them at a fixed freq of 80Hz. The LED panels were fixed to the box such that they were directed at streams of water that were being pulsed by two speakers.</p>
                            <p> <b>Control Interface</b>As I was thinking about the control paradigm for my lab, a friend had showed me a youtube video of a Theremin. Traditionally, a theremin is an instrument made of two metal antennas. When someone moves there hands around the antennas, the proximities of one of the user's hands controls frequency oscillations and the other controls volume of the instrument. For my project, I connected to range finder sensors to an audio circuit. The theremin would output lovely notes as the user controlled the frequency of the speakers by moving their hands up and down above the range finders. Changing the frequency of the speakers would create the illusion that the stream of water is a stationary, falling or rising chain of droplets.

                            <p><b>Lessons Learned</b> From this project, I learned the value of building and testing early. I created this working display in the span of six weeks, however the project would not have been successful if I had not realized early that I needed to test fast. I had to re-order some new LEDs when I wasn't satisfied with my first test iteration. I learned that lab resources also had wait times and as always in engineering, if a component doesnt' work, then you need time to redesign.
